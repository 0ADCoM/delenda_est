	"History":"Epirus was a Greek kingdom made famous by King Pyrrhus of Epirus (Pyrrhos ton Epeiros), when he took the offer from the Italian Greek city Tarentum (Taras) for help against the Romans. Epirus itself was a newly united state, formerly divided among the 3 chief tribes Chaonians, Thesprotians, and the powerful Molossians. Pyrrhos' uncle was Alexander I the Molossian, a contemporary of Alexander the Great, who, like Pyrrhos, also warred against the Romans. A few times the king of Epirus even managed to steal the throne of Macedonia for himself, once by Pyrrhos and once by his son Alexander II of Epirus. Later, Epirus founded itself as a federal democracy, but was broken up once the Romans warred with Macedon.",
