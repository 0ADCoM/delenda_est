An overhaul mod for 0 A.D. Empires Ascendant

===========
OVERVIEW

This is an overhaul mod for 0 A.D. Empires Ascendant. Its goal is to introduce a new balance scheme, a revamped and greatly expanded technology tree, and other customizations to the game. The mod endeavors to push the game's modding capability to the fullest and to make the gameplay as enjoyable and as rich as possible.

Major Unimplemented Features that this document assumes will eventually be Implemented:

- Formations: This mod re-enables the old formations from Alpha 16 and before. Once these are reimplemented by the official WFG team, it is planned to revamp them completely for this mod.
- Trample: Some cavalry are planned to be better tramplers than others, so their stats would be adjusted accordingly. So, until Trample is implemented by the team or by modders some Cavalry stats may be wonky.
- Charging/Charge Bonus: Like Trample, this would affect Cavalry stats immensely, and it is hoped that this is eventually implemented in the game.
- Mercenary Camps: This mod starts the process of making Mercenaries a unique class of soldier for the game. It is hoped that either the official team or modders will implement the capturable Mercenary Camp idea talked about on the forum.
- Building Capturing and Unit Conversion using a "Loyalty" mechanic: Some techs in this mod cannot be implemented yet (or are implemented in a different way) because capturing and loyalty are not implemented. Hopefully this feature is implemented so this mod can add another layer of richness to the gameplay.
